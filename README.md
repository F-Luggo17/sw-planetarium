# Star Wars Planetarium

Star Wars Planetarium is a web application built using Create React App.

The application uses SWAPI (Star Wars API) to get data from the Star Wars Universe like their planets, residents and more (but the other data is not included in this demo lol).

To improve UI and UX, I integrated Tailwind CSS to create a responsive web application no matter the size of the device. 

Additionally, HeroIcons were incorporated to have a better look and feel.

Explore the galaxy of Star Wars with this planetarium, but use the data with responsability uhh!
